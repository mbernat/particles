# Particles

A simple particle system in Rust (language).

## Installing Rust

You need to have the Rust toolchain installed to build the project. Please follow the [official instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust.

## Running the app

With the Rust toolchain installed it should suffice to run the following command in this directory.

```
cargo run --release
```

## Controls

So far only mouse control is implemented. The particles follow the mouse.

When the left mouse button is pressed they do so more eagerly.
